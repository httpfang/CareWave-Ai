## 🤖 Introduction

**CareWave-AI** combines the power of AI with compassionate healthcare, providing an efficient way to personalize cancer care. Thanks to our buddy Gemini AI, the app analyzes patient data to craft treatment plans tailored to each person. This one's for you, healthcare warriors! 💪

## 🌟 Features

- **Smart Treatment Plans**: Using guidelines and patient data, CareWave finds gaps in cancer screenings and suggests follow-up care. Think of it as a tailored, virtual doctor assistant. 🩺
- **Secured Sharing**: We know privacy matters! CareWave keeps patient data safe and sound using top-notch encryption so only the right eyes see the info. 🔒

## 💡 Inspiration

This project was born from a place of love and resilience. When my grandmother bravely battled cancer, she faced challenges like keeping up with appointments and managing her treatment. CareWave-AI is dedicated to making that journey easier for other patients and their families. ❤️
